# API Gateway Configuration File
# This file controls the strangler pattern routing behavior

# Strangler Pattern Configuration
# The strangler pattern allows gradual migration from V1 to V2
# v1_percentage: P% of user requests go to V1
# v2_percentage: (100-P)% of user requests go to V2
strangler_pattern:
  enabled: true
  v1_percentage: 80    # 80% of requests go to V1
  v2_percentage: 20    # 20% of requests go to V2

# NOTE: Service URLs are now set via environment variables:
# - USER_V1_URL
# - USER_V2_URL  
# - ORDER_SERVICE_URL
# - EVENT_SERVICE_URL
# This allows different URLs for local dev vs Azure deployment

# Request timeout in seconds
timeout: 10
